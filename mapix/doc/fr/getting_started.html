		<h2>Creating a new website</h2>
		<p>Mapix distribution contains a demo site and a back-office (administration site)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to http://localhost, and click on administration site</li>
			<li>Login using "admin" and "demo". You can now browse your document root using the folder editor.</li>
			<li>
				To begin, copy and paste the demo folder to a new "yoursite" folder : to do that, just right-click on the demo folder
				and left-click on the "copy" menu, fill in the new folder name ("yoursite") and submit.
			</li>
			<li>
				Then double-click on the index.map file : this will open the main map file in the XML editor.
				Just change the location of your site map file : replace "demo/index.map" by "yoursite/index.map" and save.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now double-click on the "yoursite" folder and start creating or editing your site files :
				you already got a content and a images folder, and you may want to create other folders, like templates, css, js...
				But before doing this, go to the content folder and try to edit some content files, like content/home.xml.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Creating stylesheets and templates</h2>
		<p>
			So now you want to create your own stylesheets or templates, right ?
			Then create a css folder and a create a new text file called "common.css".
			From this point, your site should appear "naked", why ? Well because you have overriden
			a file located in the common folder (precisely /common/css/common.css)
			and this file is used by the default template (/common/templates/content.xsl) to style your page.
			The same thing happens if you create a templates/content.xsl in yoursite folder : mapix will ne longer use the /common/templates/content.xsl template.
			Before creating a new file, you should think whether this file will be exclusive to your site
			or whether this file might be shared with other sites. If your file is specific to your site, then go on and create it in yoursite,
			else you can also create new files and folders in the common folder.
		</p>
		<h2>File Editors</h2>
		<p>
			Mapix admin site is designed to edit different kind of files : folder, image, xml, text, svg...
			When you double-click on a file, the matching editor will automatically be used to open the file.
			XML files are opened using the XML editor, that aims to simplify document edition.
			You can switch to the text editor (when the document is opened in the xml editor, just click on the text editor menu)
			In the XML editor, right-click on a node to display the contextual menu.
			Templates are stored in the templates dir and use the XSL language.
			XSL files are also opened with the XML editor, but it is recommended to use the text editor instead
			(or else, developpers comments in templates could be lost).
			Be careful when you modify a document, not to loose information (keep the backup option checked)
		</p>
		<h2>Folder Editor</h2>
		<p>
			The folder editor has a particular place in admin site, because you will spend a lot of time using it.
			You can access the folder editor menu using right-click on a specific file.
			Folder editor allows you to do a lot of harmful operations : create, copy, move, delete, rename, upload, zip/unzip, save/restore, lock/unlock...
			Some of these operations (unlike in file editors) cannot be reversed : for example, you won't be able to restore a deleted file if you haven't saved it before.
			Consider using the Save menu from time to time to keep a copy of your files or folders.
		</p>
		<h2>Package manager</h2>
		<p>
			The package manager allows you to update, upgrade, install or uninstall Mapix CMS packages anywhere under your document root.
			These operations also cannot be reversed (unless you used the Save menu before).
			It is strongly recommended to upgrade a package which version is marked stable.
			Non-stable packages should not be used in production environnements.
		</p>
		<p>A package may usually be installed in three different places :</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>the document root</strong> : only mapix core, common and websites should be installed here, Mapix framework and CMS can be fully upgraded from the package manager</li>
			<li><strong>the common folder</strong> : install here packages that may be shared between different sites</li>
			<li><strong>a website folder</strong> : install here packages that will be used only in this website (this may also concern admin site packages)</li>
		</ul>
