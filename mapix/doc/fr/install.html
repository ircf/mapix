		<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
		<p>Mapix requires the following configuration :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Apache with .htaccess (mod_rewrite) enabled.</li>
			<li>PHP 5.2+ with DOM, XSL and CURL extensions</li>
			<li>PHP should NOT be run in Safe Mode (check your php.ini)</li>
			<li>The convert program is required by the images editor (resize, crop, rotate)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Any other recommendation or security issue concerning mapix installation is welcome, please email me at gpl@ircf.fr or use mapix tracker at sourceforge.</p>
		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Download and untar the Mapix tarball in your webroot directory :</p>
				<pre>
					cd /path/to/webroot
					wget http://gpl.ircf.fr/mapix-version.tar.gz
					tar -zxvf mapix-version.tar.gz
				</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Chown and chmod your webroot directory for your apache user to have read and write access :</p>
				<pre>
					chown -R . apache.apache
					chmod -R 755 /path/to/webroot
				</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Go to your httpd.conf and set the following parameters in the Directory tag, then restart Apache :</p>
				<pre>
					AllowOverride All
					php_admin_value open_basedir /path/to/webroot:/tmp 
				</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Customize the .htaccess to allow only your web host to access xsl and php services :</p>
				<p>
					uncomment the last part of the .htaccess file and replace localhost with your domain name
					(it seems that localhost doesn't work except when your site is called with http://localhost)
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Launch the welcome page on your favourite browser :</p>
				<pre>
					lynx http://yourserver/
				</pre>
			</li>
		</ol>

			Feel free to complete or to modify this organization to fit your needs,<br/>
			but don't forget to check the .core/config.php file once you've done.
		</p>
		<h2>Notice concerning PHP services</h2>
		<p>
			Mapix aims to separate content from layout.
			PHP programs (services) are considered as dynamic content providers.
			PHP services should only be used to execute programs or system commands and should return (echo)
			a clean XML result with variables to display or use in XSL templates.
			Try not to use hardcoded HTML in PHP services.
			It is possible to use standalone PHP pages in your mapix site, but it isn't recommended.
