		<h2>1. What is mapix ?</h2>
		<p>
			Mapix is a framework and a CMS (also called CMF) written in PHP, under the GPL license (see COPYING for the license terms)
			It's designed to develop websites entirely (as far as possible) with the XML/XSL technology.
			Mapix framework is a gateway between the HTTP server and XML services.
			Mapix CMS aims to be lightweight, multisite, localized, unobstrusive and modular (packages).
