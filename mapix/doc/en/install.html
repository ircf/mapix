		<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
		<p>Mapix requires the following configuration :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Apache with .htaccess (mod_rewrite) enabled.</li>
			<li>PHP 5.2+ with DOM, XSL and CURL extensions</li>
			<li>PHP should NOT be run in Safe Mode (check your php.ini)</li>
			<li>The convert program is required by the images editor (resize, crop, rotate)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Any other recommendation or security issue concerning mapix installation is welcome, please email me at gpl@ircf.fr or use mapix tracker at sourceforge.</p>
		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Download and untar the Mapix tarball in your webroot directory :</p>
				<pre>
					cd /path/to/webroot
					wget http://gpl.ircf.fr/mapix-version.tar.gz
					tar -zxvf mapix-version.tar.gz
				</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Chown and chmod your webroot directory for your apache user to have read and write access :</p>
				<pre>
					chown -R . apache.apache
					chmod -R 755 /path/to/webroot
				</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Go to your httpd.conf and set the following parameters in the Directory tag, then restart Apache :</p>
				<pre>
					AllowOverride All
					php_admin_value open_basedir /path/to/webroot:/tmp 
				</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Customize the .htaccess to allow only your web host to access xsl and php services :</p>
				<p>
					uncomment the last part of the .htaccess file and replace localhost with your domain name
					(it seems that localhost doesn't work except when your site is called with http://localhost)
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Launch the welcome page on your favourite browser :</p>
				<pre>
					lynx http://yourserver/
				</pre>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Overview of Mapix files and directories</h2>
		<p>A Mapix CMS setup should always contain at least those files and directories :</p>
		<table>
			<tbody>
				<tr><th>mapix/</th><td>This will be referred as the "mapix folder". It contains all mapix packages. You should NOT modify files in this folder or your modifications will be lost when mapix upgrades (except if you maintain your own packages)</td></tr>
				<tr><th>.htaccess</th><td>Rewrites all URL that don't match an existing file to the mapix/core/xrt.php program</td></tr>
				<tr><th>controller.xsl</th><td>Your website main controller</td></tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<h2>Single website configuration</h2>
		<p>If you want to use mapix CMS for a single site, you can add your files and folders at the same level. You can use whatever file names and structure you want, but it is strongly recommended to follow the mapix packages conventions (see the package tutorial)</p>
		<h2>Multiple website configuration on same installation</h2>
		<p>If you wanty to serve multiple websites (from one or more domains, subdomains or folders) on a single virtual host, you can create a folder for each website at the same level. Each folder will contain its own controller (controller.xsl). In the main controller.xsl, simply include all websites controller. The condition to match a domain or a subdomain can be added whether in the main or (recommended) in each website controller.</p>
		<h2>Multiple websites configuration on separate installations</h2>
		<p>To enforce security, it's better to set one website in one virtual host. Indeed you can share a unique mapix/ folder between all websites by using a symbolic link : Copy the mapix/ folder in a separate folder (e.g. /usr/share/mapix), add /usr/share/mapix to your open_basedir setup, and create a symbolic link from each document root to your mapix folder (e.g. ln -s /usr/share/mapix /path/to/webroot/mapix).</p>
